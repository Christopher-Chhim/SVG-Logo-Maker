# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

My motivation in developing this project was to become more familiar with node.js. The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application that allows users to create custom SVG logos. Users can select from different shapes (Circle, Triangle, Square), set their colors, and add text to the logo. The generated SVG file can be used for various purposes, such as branding, website logos, and more. 

## Installation

Download VSCode.
Download Node.js.
Download inquirer (npm install).
Download Jest (npm install).

## Usage

Run 'node index.js' on the terminal. Answer the prompt to your liking and answer the prompt accordingly. The first prompt will ask the user to enter text (of up to 3) characters for the logo. Next, it will give users a list of options for the color of their choosing for the text. Consequentially, users are prompted to choose between a triangle, square, and circle for their SVG logo. As a result, users are given a list of options for the color of their choosing for their shape. Once completed, the terminal should notify the user that a logo.svg file has been generated in the examples folder. Check to see if a logo.svg file has been generated and if it matches user input.

## Tests

Three tests have been incorporated in this application, one for each shape. Make a logo with each shape to make sure that all shapes are working. Answer the prompt however you like and see if the logo.svg file is being generated to your liking.
